# RubiksPatterns
Do you have a Rubik's Cube? If so, are you unable to solve it? Are you looking for something else to do with your Cube? If you answered YES to either of these, this is for you. I will guide you through each step of how to solve your Cube, as well as some cool PATTERNS! I will also provide images of what your cube should look like after each step.
